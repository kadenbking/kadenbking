## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

My name is Kaden. I decided in college that I would adopt the personal slogan:

```
Disciple of Christ. Writer of code.
```

It describes well two important things about myself:

1. `Disciple of Christ.` -- I am convicted by the power of the gospel (`Rom. 1:16`) that Jesus Christ of Nazareth be the foremost priority in my life. Nothing else really matters in comparison to knowing personally the LORD of all creation (`Phil. 3:8-11; Ps. 27:4`).

2. `Writer of Code.` -- Does this `.md` count? (No, like `HTML`, it's markup, not programming.) I'm blessed to say I get to write code (both markup -- documentation is `!important` -- and in a variety of programming languages) to earn a living. Writing code is similar to solving puzzles daily. It's fun! And `if` you're reading this, `then` you most likely know what I mean!

Aside from the above, I really enjoy design work too! I've created a personal brandmark simply because I think it's fun (not that I need it in the slightest):

You can see examples of other brandmarks and various designs I've worked on at my personal portfolio site: [kadenbking.com](https://www.kadenbking.com).
